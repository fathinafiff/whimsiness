- put it in /.local/share/nautilus/scripts

- and pin it on your dock as if it were an app :)
- include actions: delete the entry, edit it, open the location of the file or folder
- Theoretically desktop agnostic

Require: deepin-icon-theme installed.
Create a local icon theme, which inherits from deepin-icon-theme, but:
- Which also fixes nonstandard stuff in the original theme (like broken download icon).
- Have icons made for Deepin DE be applied to GNOME apps.
- Have deepin icons be applied a bit more broadly outside of their DE.
